<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">At Work.</spain> Kristof is a humanist & motivated entrepreneur, passionate about helping to make the world a better place.</p>

<p class="text-base">Open source software that creates neutral, green and affordable internet capacity, by people, for people. 100% decentralized.</p>

<p class="text-base">He has a history of inventing and developing new IT infrastructure systems (storage, automation, cloud computing). Kristof has founded more than 10 companies of which 6 have been acquired by large IT players. He was lucky to be part of the first teams building the Internet and has helped to grow datacenters & ISPs mainly in Europe.</p>

<p class="text-base">Currently Kristof is CEO of Incubaid, as well as the ThreeFold Foundation, and ThreeFold Tech. He strongly believes there is need for a decentralized, neutral, affordable, green internet (owned by billions).</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Spare time.</spain> Although very fond of being in front of his computer coding, in his spare time Kristof loves being outdoors. Hiking, sailing, kitesurfing, you name it, Kristof can do it (â€“ some things better than the others, but he's always looking to grow). A business, a sport, whatever you throw at him, Kristof's reply will be, "Let's go."</p>
