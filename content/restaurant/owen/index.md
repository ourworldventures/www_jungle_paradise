<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">At Work.</spain> AOwen is an experienced executive in the IT space, having led several multi-billion dollar businesses for HP in all world-wide markets. He was responsible for HP’s world-wide Finance Industry business, launched HP in to the emerging markets of Sub-Saharan Africa and Middle East and ran HP’s subsidiary in Russia with an emphasis on improving balance of trade, R&D and corporate citizenship.</p>

Among others he has worked with cutting-edge companies in Cloud- and Edge computing; Smart City technologies; Eco-Tech; Fin-Tech; Reg-Tech and Digital Marketing; Block-chain and Cryptocurrency.</p>

<p class="text-base">In addition to working with Private Equity funds in New York, Russia and Austria, he was also advising various Family Offices. He is also an advisor to the Austrian Government in attracting foreign investment to Austria.</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Inspiration.</spain> n all walks of life, I look for an equitable exchange of value and believe in doing everything in a socially responsible way. I love working with diverse teams as they best represent our amazing planet. Emerging markets have been my passion and my profession. Once described as an optimist and anarchist, I love doing things in an unconventional way. All of this and more has led me to Incubaid.</p>


<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">At Play.</spain> Outside of work, you can find me outside – skiing (when the weather allows), biking, hiking, and gardening. I have been to 147 countries on last count, so one might say I like to travel.</p>
