<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">At Work.</spain> Jan has been with Incubaid since the very beginning as head of research and development. </p>

<p class="text-base">Jan’s field of expertise is not one but many. You could say he’s one of Kristof’s go-to guys when it comes to fixing anything networking related. There hasn’t been a datacenter in the Incubaid family that held secrets from Jan, and if they did he would find them and probably make even the secrets more efficient.</p>

<p class="text-base">Currently Jan is Head of R&D at Incubaid and ThreeFold.tech.</p>


<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">At Play.</spain> Jan used to be a true daredevil. If he wasn’t driving his 1200 cc Ducati he would be climbing rock faces all over Europe. Although he still enjoys looking at these things he now chooses a more relaxing lifestyle. Cuddling his 14 kilogram cats, hanging out in his sauna, and practicing nerdy mindfulness by figuring out how to embed Rust code on tiny circuit boards. </p>
