#### The Problem

<p class="text-base">There are some major challenges with the current foundation of the internet and how it has moved from being a medium to independently share information amongst internet users, to a multi-billion dollar industry governed by a few companies.<br><br>The technology that generates internet capacity, services and applications is expensive, power hungry and centralized, as a result, it's not inclusive, affordable, sustainable or scalable.
<br><br>80% of todayâ€™s internet capacity is centralized. Data is monopolized and controlled by a few. Your information is not private.</p>

<br>

#### The ThreeFold Foundation Solution

<p class="text-base">A decentralized grid of internet compute & capacity focused on democratizing internet compute and storage capacity to enable a responsible internet for all.</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Neutral.</spain> No one single company or person can ever monopolize the Threefold Grid due to decentralization.</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Scaleable.</spain> Lightweight technology and self-healing technology makes it scale with ease and endlessly.</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Blockchain Enabled.</spain> Tokens are created only when capacity is added to the grid. Also doubles as payment mechanism to provision workloads.</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Future Workloads</spain> The decentralized nature of the grid makes it very compatible with IOT, 5G, and other workloads of the future.</p>
