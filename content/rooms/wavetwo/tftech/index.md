#### The Problem

<p class="text-base">Large, centralized datacenters are owned by just a few companies. They are only located in star topologies and energy-dense areas, and they are power-hungry.<br><br>The approach of adding more – people and layers – to achieve security is flawed.
<br><br>With the demand for IT capacity growing tremendously, these methods are not build for the future. There are enough issues today.</p>
