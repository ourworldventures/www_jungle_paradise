#### The Problem

<p class="text-base">At the launch of the ThreeFold Grid a lot of people ventured into DIY farming, and with success as the grid has grown immensly. Still some people did not want to dive into installing their own farming equipment or building it from scratch. </p>

<br>

#### The BetterToken Solution

<p class="text-base">BetterToken has developed a easy way to start farming ThreeFold tokens. Customers can easily select a SoHo server and it's specification in the webshop. BetterToken makes sure this server then is 100% farming ready all the customer needs to do is plug in the ethernet cable and powercable to start farming ThreeFold Tokens. Upside to farming with BetterToken Soho-Nodes is that all equipment is certified by ThreeFold and this makes that cultivation tokens are released sooner than tokens cultivated on DIY Farms.</p>

### CUSTOMISE
