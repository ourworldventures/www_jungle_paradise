#### The Problem

<p class="text-base">We don’t need third-parties in digital commerce — yet they keep growing. And getting more dangerous.</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">No sovereignty or control :</spain> Centralized exchanges and wallets have custody of funds and require middlemen</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Huge security and data privacy issues :</spain> Large exchanges are easy targets for hacks with little recourse or protection</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Market manipulation and no transparency :</spain> Fake volumes and market-making, algorithmic trading</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Complexity and lack of information :</spain> Hard to navigate exchanges, manage private keys, make informed decisions</p>

<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Not enough interoperability :</spain> Existing platforms seek to lock in users to their own ecosystems</p>

<br>

#### Solution & Mission

<p class="text-base">Open-source, peer-to-peer financial tools that are quantum-safe and built on decentralized capacity</p>



<p class="text-base"><spain class="font-bold">Scaleable.</spain> Lightweight technology and self-healing technology makes it scale with ease and endlessly.<br><br>Storage, exchange and trade operations are the foundation of the economic machine. We believe that everyone has right to access free and open instruments that enable storage, exchange and trade in a fair and transparent way. </p>
