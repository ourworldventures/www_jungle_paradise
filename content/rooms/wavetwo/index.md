<h2 class="greenheader">Wave Two :</h2>

We believe doing good for the world and doing business can go hand in hand. We are building companies which will help to achieve an ambituous global goal:

**Allow everyone to have unlimited access to Education, Sustainable Internet, and Complementary Digital Currencies for less than 1% of their monthly salary.**

To reach this goal the world needs next-generation technologies that open education, mobile, and financial systems up for all.
