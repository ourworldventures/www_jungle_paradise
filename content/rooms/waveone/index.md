<h2 class="greenheader">Wave One :</h2>

**More than $500 million in exits with less than $50 million investment.**

<p class="text-base">Our focus during Wave One was very IT-centric – around storage, automation and cloud. During this wave from 2000 till 2015 some of our companies defined parts of the cloud landscape, and are still being used actively today.</p>

<p class="text-base">Our team was involved in technologies like:</p>

##### - OpenStack

##### - ZFS (the storage system)
##### - The first data dedupe system for backup in the world
##### - The first distributed storage system for large archive solutions
##### - The most used hypervisor in the world
